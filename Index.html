            <p>Hi, I am Vedant Gupta. I am 11 years old. I was born in Noida, India. I've lived in the UK and India, when I was five I moved to the USA and lived in Arizona and then lived in Seattle, Washington for 6 years before moving here to California.
                I like to play a lot of sports. My favorite sport is Cricket. I also play other sports like tennis, soccer, swimming, and football.

                I love to read. My favorite books are mythology books like Rick Riordan’s book and Fantasy magic like Harry Potter and other random books like maze runner, the hunger games, artemis fowl, the ranger's apprentice, and ect.
             When I grow up I want to be Doctor because I like and am good at biology. But I also want to be a software engineer because I like doing stuff with technology.
             
                I love animals too. I really want to get a dog. My favorite animal is wolves because they are so fascinating with their ability to run for hours. I also like the other animals learning about them is so fascinating.
                I’m a great photographer too. I like to take more nature photos. I can take photos of lots of things. I love to take photos.
